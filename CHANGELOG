        o Simplified SunOS fix
        o Local feeds (/home/user/file.xml) should work

    * Improved empty feed checking
    * Improved invalid feed messages
    * Unfortunately, rss2email is no longer compatible with Python v2.1. Two of the most serious lingering issues with rss2email were waiting forever for non-responsive feeds and its inablility to properly handle feeds with international characters. To properly fix these once and for all, rss2email now depends on functionality that was not available until Python v2.2. Hopefully this does not unduly inconvenience anyone that has not yet upgraded to a more current version of Python.

v2.57 (2006-04-07)
    * Integrated Joey Hess's patches
       o First, a patch that makes delete more reliable, so it no longer allows you to remove the default email address ('feed' 0) and thereby hose your feed file, or 'remove' entries that don't exist without warning; and so it only says IDs have changed when they really have. Originally from http://bugs.debian.org/313101
       o Next a patch that avoids a backtrace if there's no email address defined, and outputs a less scary error message.
       o Next, a simple change to the usage; since the "email" subcommand always needs a parameter, don't mark it as optional.
       o And, avoid a backtrace if the email subcommand does get run w/o a parameter.
       o And also avoid backtraces if delete is run w/o a parameter. Also adds support for --help.
       o Simple change, make a comment match reality (/usr/sbin/sendmail)
       o This avoids another backtrace, this time if there's no feed file yet. [load()]
       o Add a handler for the AttributeError exception, which feedparser can throw. Beats crashing..
       o Next, four hunks that make it more robust if no default email address is set and feeds are added w/o an email address. This patch originally comes from http://bugs.debian.org/310485 which has some examples.
       o Finally, this works around a bug in mimify that causes it to add a newline to the subject header if it contains very long words. Details at http://bugs.debian.org/320185. Note that Tatsuya Kinoshita has a larger patch torard the end of that bug report that deals with some other problems in this area, Aaron has seen that patch before and said it "looks pretty reasonable".
